    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Overnight Oats is a hearty snack that can even serve as a breakfast.
        Oats do not require heat to be safe for eating so with overnight oats,
        you'll let them soak in the fridge to soften up.
    </p>
    <p>Prep time is 5 minutes active but they'll need to be in the fridge for 6
         to 8 hours.  Suggested serving size is half a cup of oats so make
        as many as you want (or as many mason jars as you have).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 / 2 cup traditional Oats</li>
        <li>1 / 3 cup of milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of Vanilla syrup</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the oats into the mason jar</li>
        <li>Mix the milk and vanilla syrup together (let one of your mason jars serve as the mixing bowl)</li>
        <li>Pour milk and syrup over the oats</li>
        <li>Seal the jar and leave it in the fridge overnight</li>
    </ol>
